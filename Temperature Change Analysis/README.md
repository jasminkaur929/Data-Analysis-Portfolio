# Temperature Change Analysis
The mean surface temperature change has been consistently rising worldwide, alerting signs of climate change and global warming â€“ which is caused by the burning of fossil fuels. This project measures levels of temperature fluctuations and gas emissions by country and year (1960-2020). Using Pearson's correlation statistical analysis, the relationship between the two is tested. Other factors on territories facing the most climate change and emitting the highest CO2 emissions are also revealed.
