### AEMR Analysis
The American Energy Market Regulator (AEMR) is responsible for looking after the United States of Americaâ€™s domestic energy network. Out of the four types of outages, AEMR only penalizes Forced outages. If enough energy providers enter the Forced outage state, stress will be put on the energy system and threaten the reliability of the network. This analysis will result in the identification of key providers causing the largest financial risk and the most energy lost.
